In this blog, I’ll walk you through my study journey, the resources that fueled my passion, and the tips that helped me pass the exam.

# **Where I take the exam?**

I booked my exam at a Pearson VUE testing center because I feel more comfortable taking the exam in person rather than online, and this helps me avoid any potential technical issues that could lead to my exam being forfeited.

# **Exam Day**

On exam day, I made sure to get enough sleep the night before. This helped me stay focused and alert during the exam. I also took my time to read each question carefully to ensure I fully understood what was being asked. After finishing the exam, I received my results immediately, and I was thrilled to see that I had passed the **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** exam! I’m now officially certified. Shortly after, Pearson VUE also emailed me with instructions on how to claim my badge on **Credly**.
