Passing the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03) certification was a significant milestone in my cloud journey. As a beginner with no prior cloud experience, this certification felt like a challenging yet achievable goal. After passing my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CCP), I decided to take on the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate (SAA-C03) as the next step in advancing my cloud expertise. In this blog, I’ll share the tips, resources, and strategies that helped me succeed, so you can confidently prepare and pass the exam too.

# **Understanding the Exam Blueprint**

The first step in my preparation was to familiarize myself with the AWS Solutions Architect – Associate exam blueprint. This helped me understand the key domains and their weightage:

* **Domain 3: Design High-Performing Architectures** (24%)
    
* **Domain 4: Design Cost-Optimized Architectures** (20%)
    

Knowing the weight of each domain allowed me to prioritize my study time effectively.

#   
**Building a Strong Foundation in Core AWS Services**

The SAA-C03 exam requires a solid understanding of core AWS services. Here’s where I focused:

* **Compute**: EC2, Lambda, Auto Scaling
    
* **Storage**: S3, EBS, Glacier
    
* **Networking**: VPC, Route 53, CloudFront
    
* **Databases**: RDS, DynamoDB, Aurora
    
* **Security**: IAM, KMS, Security Groups
    

# **Leveraging Study Resources**

### **Online Courses**

* **Udemy**: Stephane Maarek's AWS Solutions Architect course on Udemy prepares learners for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate exam. It covers AWS core services, security, networking, and architecture best practices with hands-on labs and real-world scenarios, praised for its clarity and practical approach.
    

### **Practice Exams**

* **Tutorials Dojo**: Tutorials Dojo, created by Filipino Jon Bonso, is known for its high-quality AWS practice exams with a high passing rate. The platform offers realistic questions and detailed explanations, helping many achieve AWS certification success.  
      
    

# **Gaining Hands-On Experience**

While theory is essential, hands-on practice solidified my understanding:

* **Built a Multi-Tier Architecture**: Deployed a web app using EC2, S3, RDS, and an Application Load Balancer.
    
* **Utilized Free Tier**: Experimented with services like Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFormation.
    
* **Created IAM Policies**: Practiced setting up secure access controls.
    

This is where the real excitement begins! As I ventured deeper into AWS, I discovered the joy of turning theory into practice. From deploying multi-tier applications to experimenting with cutting-edge services, my hands-on projects brought AWS concepts to life. And guess what? I’m just getting started! Stay tuned to my blog as I share more thrilling updates, practical tips, and lessons learned on my AWS cloud journey.

# **Time Management and Exam Strategy**

Here’s how I stayed organized and maximized my exam performance:

* **Daily Study Routine**: I dedicated 2–3 hours daily for two months.
    
* **Review Notes Regularly**: Summarized key concepts and revisited them often.
    
* **Simulate Exam Conditions**: Took practice exams in a timed environment to improve my pace.
    
* **Flag and Review**: In the actual exam, I flagged tough questions and revisited them after answering the easier ones.  
      
    

# **My Exam Experience: Before and After**

### Before the Exam

As the exam day approached, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. I made sure to stick to my study plan, revisiting key concepts and taking additional practice exams to build my confidence.

### During the Exam

The actual exam was a test of both knowledge and time management. Some questions were straightforward, while others required deep thought and careful analysis of scenarios. I eliminated the possible incorrect answers and flagged the more challenging ones for review later.

### After the Exam

The air in the exam room hung heavy with the tension of a thousand unspoken questions. I had just finished the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate exam, my mind a whirlwind of uncertainties. Unlike the Cloud Practitioner, where the pass/fail result popped up instantly, this one left me hanging. A gnawing anxiety settled in, a constant loop of "Did I get that S3 question right?" and "Should I have chosen VPC peering or a VPN?"

Four hours later, my phone buzzed. The email subject line: "AWS Certification Exam Results." My heart pounded against my ribs like a trapped bird. It was now or never. With trembling fingers, I opened the email.

**I saw Congratulations!** you just earned a badge from Amazon Web Services Training and Certification. A wave of relief washed over me, so intense it almost brought me to tears. This wasn't just a test; it was a culmination of weeks of grueling study, late nights, and countless cups of coffee.

This was my first associate-level certification, a significant milestone in my AWS journey. The weight of the achievement settled in, a warm glow of accomplishment replacing the earlier anxiety. I had done it. I was officially an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate.
